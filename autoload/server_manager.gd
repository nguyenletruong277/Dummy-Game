# ==========================================
# SERVER MANAGER — CHANGES IN THIS PASS
# 1. _reset_match_state() no longer calls PlayerManager.reset_manager() in a
#    loop (that wiped the ENTIRE players_state dict right before
#    assign_roles/assign_tasks needed it — would crash on match start).
#    Now calls PlayerManager.reset_players_for_new_round() once, which only
#    resets per-round fields and keeps the roster intact.
# 2. Removed the _ready() subscription to NetworkManager.player_disconnected.
#    It was connected directly to _sync_players_state(Dictionary), but the
#    signal emits an int (peer_id) — type mismatch, would break on any
#    disconnect. Per our ownership split, ServerManager doesn't own
#    disconnect-triggered sync anyway (that's NetworkManager's job, next pass).
# 3. _sync_players_state was being called directly instead of via .rpc(),
#    so the @rpc annotation was a no-op and ready-state changes never
#    actually reached other clients — only the server's own local copy
#    updated. Now calls _sync_players_state.rpc(...).
# 4. All direct players_state[id][...] writes replaced with PlayerManager
#    setters (set_role, set_assigned_tasks, add_done_task) per the
#    "PlayerManager owns all writes" decision.
